    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <b1>Hi! I am Arch who is currently working on a personal mail fetcher for testmail (@inbox.testmail.app). It may get released, feel free to add me on Discord and ask about it or me if you want (Arch1010#4338).</b1><br>
    <b1>There is plenty of other stuff about me, but I won't reveal irl things until I feel comfortable and 18+.</b1><br>
    <h3>Cookie Learning</h3>
    <b1>I have finally learned how to use same-site cookies. Etc, you have visited this website: <b1 id="visits"></b1> times.<br>
    <b1>This is a great accomplishment to me, as I have wondered before, and finally decided to do so.</b1><br>
    <h3>Api Usage</h3>
    <b1>I have finally figured out accessing an API somewhat easily, just not how to create it.</b1><br>
    <h3>Discord Bots</h3>
    <b1>Honestly, I am doing pretty well recalling what to do from memory, what sucks is that I don't know how to fetch a role.</b1><br>
    <b1>discord.js's files are still old and uses message.xyz in some spots instead of interaction.xyz .</b1><br>
    <h3>More About Myself</h3>
    <b1>Well. You already know me somewhat, but I have plans on becoming a software Enginner.<br> Though, I also wish to become Non-Binary!<br>
    I am currently in HS, taking a college block schedule.</b1>
